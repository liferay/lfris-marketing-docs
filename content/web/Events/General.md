# Events Microsites
> Supporting Liferay's year-round event marketing initiatives.

## Making Content Changes
Event microsite content changes are made primarily from **OSB Marketing Events Admin**, which requires the **Marketing Events Administrator** role. Instructions for requesting permissions can be found <a href="https://liferay.github.io/web-dev-lrdcom/#/docs/General~2Fpermissions#process-for-granting-user-roles">here</a>.

	Once you have acquired permissions, visit the event microsite home page to access the Admin menu.

From the **Admin menu**, click: `Site Administration > Content`

## Changing Event Microsite Navigation

In general, the navigation for the events site is controlled by Site Pages. In that, any change you make to Site Pages, will reflect in the navigation.
